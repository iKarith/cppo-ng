# Test disks

Here are the test disks I am using to test cppo:

- [Asimov](): images/disk_utils/asimov/Asimov_v2.0.2mg
- [Asimov](): images/disk_utils/copy_ii/copy2+9.1.s2.dsk
- [Asimov](): images/masters/dos_3.3.dsk
- [Asimov](): images/magazines/nibble/nibble\[1991-01\].po
- [Asimov](): images/masters/prodos/ProDOS_2_4_1.dsk

More will be added and at some point I'll make a point of describing why each
of these images is a good choice.
